This meshtastic_serial+wifi folder is essentially a copy of the SendReceiveClient
from https://github.com/meshtastic/Meshtastic-arduino/tree/master/src

- Any code modules that have been changed from github has a modified file name ending 
  in ys_modified.cpp
- The edits in this directory are for the Golf Cart Computer project which uses a serial
  connection to the meshtastic radio and does not use WiFi
- If a refresh of this directory is done, unmodified files will need removal to prevent
  duplicate functions.
